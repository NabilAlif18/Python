This project was given when I participated in a virtual internship program by IDX Partner. In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing approximately 430 thousand loan data. Here I use linear regression. In this analysis I carried out several stages, such as importing libraries, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and logistic regression modeling.
